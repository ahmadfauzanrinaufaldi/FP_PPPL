## Installation

To get a local copy of the project up and running, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/fullstackexpense.git](https://github.com/yourusername/fullstackexpense.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory**:
    ```bash
    cd fullstackexpense
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
4.  **Set up Firebase Environment Variables**:
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your Firebase configuration details. You can find these in your Firebase project settings. An example structure would be:
    ```
    API_KEY="your-firebase-api-key"
    AUTH_DOMAIN="your-firebase-auth-domain"
    PROJECT_ID="your-firebase-project-id"
    STORAGE_BUCKET="your-firebase-storage-bucket"
    MESSAGING_SENDER_ID="your-firebase-messaging-sender-id"
    APP_ID="your-firebase-app-id"
    MEASUREMENT_ID="your-firebase-measurement-id"
    ```
    *Note: The `firebase-config.js` file already contains placeholder values, but it's recommended to use environment variables for sensitive information.*

5.  **Start the application**:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    The server will start at `http://localhost:3000`. You will see a message like "ðŸš€ Server running at http://localhost:3000" in your console.

6.  **Open in your browser**:
    Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.

## Usage

* **Log In**: Use your credentials to log in on the `login.html` page. Successful login redirects you to `expense.html`.
* **Expense Tracking**: Add new transactions, view a list of existing transactions, and see your updated balance on the `expense.html` page. You can also edit and delete entries.
* **Logout**: Click the "Logout" button to clear your session and return to the login page.
